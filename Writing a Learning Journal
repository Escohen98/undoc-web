     – no longer doing, but hold them accountable
    
     Framework:
    
     Standard: situation, analysis, what next?
    
     Summary, reflection, question
    
     Importance of pegging someone’s mind to what you are trying to communicate
    
     Example: Alstyne, et al, Pipelines, Platforms, and the New Rules of Strategy
    
     Summary:
    
     Sets out two forms of business: pipeline and platform
    
     Pipeline is a traditional producer to customer distribution pattern
    
     Platform: 2 things:
    
     Platform business that creates and runs platform for others’ use
    
     Mode of go-to-market and distribution for platform participants
    
     Three key shifts in platforms
    
     From resource control to resource orchestration
    
     From internal optimization to external interaction
    
     From focus on customer value to ecosystem value
    
     Value from using platforms in network effects created
    
     Clearly, different strategic options, especially related to ecosystem
    
     Reflection:
    
     Makes sense of the growth of new types of businesses: Amazon
    
     Very positive, not like article in WSJ that stresses the importance of being on the right type of platform for your products and marketplace. And an article in
    
     Business Week talked about how companies are rushing onto platforms, without thinking through strategic uses
    
     This article, and everything I’ve experienced in the marketplace suggests that platforms work best for consumer businesses, especially those that use social media for go-to-market activities
    
     We are an industrial products company, though. If we are considering any sort of participation in a platform, we need to think through whether the positives of platforms – network effects and ecosystems – benefit use.
    
     It would make sense to us to see whether our currents go-to-market activities, especially sales, have their own methods for managing connections and getting leads.
    
     If our sales reps think we could benefit from greater participation in digital forums – not necessarily platforms, we should consider building that into our strategy.
    
     Question: Before we spend time on that, though, I’d like to ask Alstyne if he thinks platforms
    
     have any value
    
     in the industrial products space.
